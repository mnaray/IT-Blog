When I was stooping around on [Ricardo](http://ricardo.ch) with my friend, I stumbled upon this offer. You'd receive 3 old computers, two screens and a drawing pad for only a single swiss franc. This just seemed mindblowing to me, so I bid on it and kind of forgot until the auction ended.

The next time I checked the page for some new offers, I noticed that there was a new notification. I won the auction! In total I had to pay six swiss francs actually because another buyer bid on it. This way I got to pick up the devices a few days later.

When I arrived at home with all the computers, I checked their insided first things first. They were squeaky clean and shown only minimal signs of usage. The previous owner obviously cleaned them out, which was a very pleasant surprise.
